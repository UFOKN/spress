**spress** provides utilities for encoding and compressing geospatial objects, such as `sf` objects.

## Installation

This package requires **C++11** for compilation. Once you have that installed,
you can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/)
with `devtools` or `pak`:

``` r
# pak
pak::pkg_install("program--/spress")

# devtools
devtools::install_github("program--/spress")
```

## Usage

**spress** offers *both* encoding and compressing utilities. For clarity, in the context of **spress**,
*encoding* refers to projecting 2-dimensional coordinates to a 1-dimensional system
(particularly, geographic coordinates to a Hilbert Curve index); whereas, *compressing* refers to
the process for reducing the object and file size of the encoded object.

### Encoding

At a high level, **spress** performs the following algorithm for encoding:

a. Given a set of points *P*
b. Retrieve *P*'s extent/bounding box
c. Create a *2^n* x *2^n* grid with centroids aligned to the extent's corner points
d. Index the grid to a Hilbert Curve
e. Assign each point in *P* to the closest index on the Hilbert Curve

A visualization of this algorithm is shown below:

![](man/figures/process.png)
After encoding, the data necessary to be stored is reduced down to:

1. The set of points *P*'s **extent**;
2. The ***n*** value used;
3. and, the list of **indices**.

With this set of data, the decoding process is exactly the reverse of the encoding algorithm.

In the visual example above, an *n* of **4** was used (since *2^4 = 16*, and we have a 16x16 grid),
however, note that the maximum possible error *E* converges toward 0 as the *extent* becomes smaller,
and as *n* grows. Thus, we can achieve a much more accurate encoding scheme by modifying these when possible.

> Realistically, this algorithm is computationally expensive if the **extent** and ***n***
> are large. However, this is mitigated via bitwise operations and taking advantage of efficient C++ structures.
> For the specifics of this, see `libspate`'s source code in `inst/include/spate.hpp`.

#### Encoding Example

```{r}
# Random set of points
P <- data.frame(
  X = c(-77.8015434499876,
        -77.8707250008617,
        -77.9212227055911,
        -77.9385055000025,
        -77.8452515318622,
        -77.8715886279598),
  Y = c(34.2961615000021,
        34.1818796104794,
        34.1447587911948,
        34.2165775000314,
        34.2218266693184,
        34.2632856737062)
)

# n = 8 --> 2^8 x 2^8 grid --> 256x256 grid
n <- 8L

# Encode using vectors
spress::encode(P$X, P$Y, n = n)

# We can also use the data.frame directly and attach to it
encoded_P <- spress::encode(P, coords = c("X", "Y"), attach = FALSE)

encoded_df <- spress::encode(P, coords = c("X", "Y"), attach = TRUE)
encoded_df
```

#### Decoding Example
We will use `encoded_P` and `encoded_df` from the encoding example
If we decode an object that used `spress::encode` to encode, there's
no need to pass `extent` or `n` to the decoding function. These values
are stored in the attributes `spress_extent` and `spress_n`, respectively.
```{r}
spress::decode(encoded_P)

# Columns `x` and `y` are the new decoded coordinate columns
# The argument `index` refers to the column index of the encoded index values
spress::decode(encoded_df, index = 3)[, c("x", "y")]
```


### Compression

> Compression is **not** implement yet as of 11/30/21.

For compression, **spress** performs the following algorithm:

1. Given a set of points *P*
2. Encode *P* based on the encoding algorithm
3. Create an ordering index for order preservation upon decompression
4. Sort indices by the encoding index, such that each point in *P* follows along corresponding Hilbert Curve
5. Keep the first encoding index and get the difference between every successive point

This algorithm returns a set of indices that (generally) should be small integers.
The returned table can then be written to any file format, preferably a columnar format
(such as [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/)),
and additionally compressed using another compression library
(such as [xz](https://tukaani.org/xz/) or [snappy](https://github.com/google/snappy)).

## C++ Library

Included in this package is the header-only C++ library `libspate`, which contains the foundational code used for encoding/decoding,
and was developed specifically for this package.

This can be found at `inst/include/spate.hpp` from the root of this repository.
Unit testing for this library is done with [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) and are contained in `inst/cpp-tests`.

> Note that the C++ code for this package contains purely the algorithm for encoding and decoding. The current roadmap for this package
> includes making the C++ library fully vendorable.
